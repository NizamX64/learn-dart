  /* 
    Variable is place to store a data, there is a lots of data type, you will discover those later.
    Variable can be useful when you have to use the same data many times, instead of you make it over and over, it's better to store it on a variable. 
    To create a variable, you can use a format: "DataType VariableName = Value;".
    You can declare most variables without explicitly specifying their type using var. Thanks to type inference, these variablesâ€™ types are determined by their initial values
